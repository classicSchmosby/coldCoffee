<h1 class="blogParagraphs">Choosing the back-end.</h1>
<p class="blogParagraphs"><strong><u>This is a super techie post, you have been warned!</u></strong></p>
<p class="blogParagraphs">When I was creating plans for this project (May 2016) I was keen to use PHP as my back-end support, and a MySQL database. My mind immediately went to this decision due to my projects at sixth form using PHP and MySQL, of which I found using this relatively pleasant. The syntax for the MySQL database was not bad and the PHP was nice to learn. As this was my first experience with back-end code, I had nothing to compare this to, so I settled.</p>
<p class="blogParagraphs">My project in sixth form was a simple discussion forum, which allowed users to register an account, create threads and upload posts to these threads. As this was part of my coursework, and therefore part of my final grade, I couldn't push it live. This meant that the site was only being hosted by a local XAMPP server, which meant the MySQL was supported by the PHPmyAdmin UI. It wasn't bad! Admittedly, the database started glitching after the site grew to over 15 users, or a single thread had over 8 posts, but I figured that was because it wasn't live and was being hosted by quite a minimalistic PC.</p>
<p class="blogParagraphs">Since starting my job as a full-time developer, I was introduced to the front-end world of .NET, and the back-end world of C#. This meant that my workplace was using Microsoft's SQL Server. I instantly noticed the UI of SQL Server Management Studio was much cleaner, even if it was busier.</p>
<p class="blogParagraphs">After working with this setup for several months, I grew the opinion that using C# was much more fun than PHP. It was a lot harder to get my head around, especially being from the world of PHP, which is a lot less complicated. That being said, there is a minority of PHP developers who are very skilled, some tend to use the framework Zend for larger applications. I did consider this for my personal projects but it seems a bit overkill.</p>
<p class="blogParagraphs">All of this is why I have chosen to use the .NET framework and C# for this project and probably my future ones. I know there are other contenders out there such as Go and Lua, but these would have been completely new to me, and it would have been pointless learning a whole new language when I had 2 others with similar purpose in my pocket.</p>
<p class="blogParagraphs">Thus concludes the geeky rant. If you have any opinions on the topics I said, you can let me know by using the <a href="#" class="whiteTextLinks"><u>contact information</u></a> provided.</p>

<h1 class="blogParagraphs">Need Hardware!!!</h1>
<p class="blogParagraphs">So for the past few days I've been working on this project pretty much full time, and I've reached the point where the majority of the front-end cannot go any further until I purchase a server. This is so I can get the forms and... well, the majority of the functions actually working.</p>
<p class="blogParagraphs">I will be purchasing additional hardware very soon, which means the back-end will begin shortly.</p>
<p class="blogParagraphs">One of the main functions that I'm really excited to get working is the rating system of each location on the map. My plan is to show a large amount of information of each place on a simple popup window, compared to redirecting the user to another page. I think this is a lot less annoying for the user, especially if they're just casually browsing. Once the window is open, there will be a chance for the user to read more about the location through voluntarily redirecting to a separate page.</p>

<h1 class="blogParagraphs">It runs! ...Eventually.</h1><br />
<p class="blogParagraphs">May, 2016. I was approached by my keen cyclist father with an idea of a new project. He details ideas for simple features and in my mind I'm already developing them further. I could see animations and features that were so clean and smooth it was like a film. "Ooohhh's" and "Ahhhh's" from users who were falling in love with this project faster than I did. But this was still all in my head. No work had been done yet.</p>
<p class="blogParagraphs">I've spent the whole weekend working on a prototype map for the site. My goal was to have a smooth, user-friendly system with several interesting features. What really happened was the map taking over a minute to load due to my huge amounts of JavaScript <i>outside</i> of the map's API. This rendering issue is clearly not going to go down well with the users, and to tell the truth, I'd be personally embarrassed if I pushed a system like that live.</p>
<p class="blogParagraphs">However, this prototype was not all disheartening. I learnt that I need to keep working at 100% in order for projects to work as well as I want them to. This means that more code is needed to make a dream come true.</p>

<h1 class="blogParagraphs">Introduction</h1><br />
<p class="blogParagraphs">Hello, reader! Starting new projects is always exciting, especially the larger ones. Regardless of only being 18, this is the biggest project that I have developed with such a small team. There are only two of us, and Ryan Easter is currently still in education; so he has less time than me. This means that I am writing the majority of this project, but he <i>is</i> still involved.</p>
<p class="blogParagraphs">It's been almost 4 months since I wrote the first line of code for this project. I think it's still in there somewhere. After spending huge amounts of time coming up with additional ideas and features for this site, it is safe to say that I'm definitely going to finish this. It will go live.</p>
<p class="blogParagraphs">Personally, I love reading about tech-project startups, and if you do too, dear reader, then you may want to continue reading. Enjoy!</p>
